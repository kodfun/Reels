  <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Sorry, checking
    all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Saving the world with meals on wheels.</p>
  <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? All I've got to do is
    pass as an ordinary human being. <strong> Simple.</strong> <em> What could possibly go wrong?</em> No… It's a thing;
    it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
  <h2>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!</h2>
  <p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. I am
    the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>

    <li>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the
      Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</li>

  <h3>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</h3>
  <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
    Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Saving the world with meals on wheels. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?</p>

    <li>No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

    <li>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the
      bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.</li>

  <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
    They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You've swallowed a planet! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</p>
  <p>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie
    to me! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan,

  <p>You've swallowed a planet! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't
    call me the Rotmeister. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're
    probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
  <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! No…
    It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal
    bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
  <p>You've swallowed a planet! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with
    more greatness. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</p>
  <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for
    it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them

  <p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop
    talking, brain thinking. Hush. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>
  <p>Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could
    possibly go wrong? I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still
    don't know why.</p>
